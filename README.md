- **app**: Core elements of the project, including routing, store initialization, styles, and the main rendering file (App.vue).
- **features**: Specific functionalities like managing card additions and removals from the shopping cart.

- **pages**: Different pages of the application, each represented by a separate file:

  - **Cart**: Page displaying the contents of the shopping cart.
  - **About Us**: Information about the project or team.
  - **Header**: Component responsible for the project header.
  - **Main**: Main content of the application.
  - **TheHome.vue**: An assembly point for the Header and Main components, providing cohesion to the home page.

- **shared**: Reusable components or information shared across different parts of the application, including the `api` folder for reusable API-related functionality.

### Display Cards Dynamically

Adjust the number of displayed cards dynamically in the [CardList.vue](#) component based on the provided argument (from 1 to 5). Modify the template section as follows:

<script setup lang="ts">
  // ... (existing script setup code)
      const response = await store.fetchProductsByCategoryId(#); // Adjust the initial count based on your requirement
  // ... (existing script setup code)
</script>

```
Now, you can dynamically control the number of displayed cards by changing the `dynamicCardCount` variable.
```
